# Aurora-Clone

Due to development for aurora builder being suspended for the time being I decided to build a clone. This version isnt complete (duh) but it will be cross platform, it uses python instead of c# (this shouldnt have too much of a preformance impact), and its opensource! It probably wont look as pretty because Im a developer not a designer. Also most importantly since Aurora uses XML you should be able to import your character from Aurora.
